        have always shared a passion for bringing people together through
        unforgettable events. Growing up, they worked in the event industry,
        gaining firsthand experience with the challenges of planning and finding
        reliable vendors. While running his donut-filled ice cream catering
        business, Zack constantly heard the same questions from Armenian
        families: “Do you know a good coffee vendor?” “Any kid entertainers?”
        “Where can I find a DJ?” Time and time again, he found himself making
        recommendations, connecting people within the community. That’s when it
        clicked—why not create a platform that makes this process effortless?
        Enter Hye Gather, a one-stop destination where Armenian families, party
        hosts, and event planners can find, compare, and book the best vendors
        in one place. No more word-of-mouth struggles—now, users can browse real
        images, read trusted reviews, and feel confident in every booking. At
        its core, Hye Gather is more than just a platform—it’s a movement. It’s
        about strengthening Armenian businesses, empowering small vendors, and
        making sure every event, from a child’s birthday to a lavish wedding, is
        as seamless as possible. With every connection made, we’re building a
        stronger, more united Armenian community—one event at a time. Welcome to
        Hye Gather, where planning your next event is simple, stress-free, and
        truly Armenian. 🎉
