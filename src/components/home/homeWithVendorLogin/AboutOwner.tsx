        Why Hye Gather
      </h2>

      <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify space-y-4">
        <p>
          Zack Gezalyan, Michael Boyadzhyan, and Alex Gevdzhyan have always
          shared a passion for bringing people together through unforgettable
          events. Growing up, they worked in the event industry, gaining
          firsthand experience with the challenges of planning and finding
          reliable vendors.
        </p>

        <p>
          While running his donut-filled ice cream catering business, Zack
          constantly heard the same questions from Armenian families: “Do you
          know a good coffee vendor?” “Any kid entertainers?” “Where can I find
          a DJ?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Time and time again, he found himself making recommendations,
          connecting people within the community. That’s when it clicked — why
          not create a platform that makes this process effortless?
        </p>

        <p>
          Enter <span className="font-semibold">Hye Gather</span>, a one-stop
          destination where Armenian families, party hosts, and event planners
          can find, compare, and book the best vendors in one place. No more
          word-of-mouth struggles — now, users can browse real images, read
          trusted reviews, and feel confident in every booking.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, Hye Gather is more than just a platform — it’s a
          movement. It’s about strengthening Armenian businesses, empowering
          small vendors, and making sure every event, from a child’s birthday to
          a lavish wedding, is as seamless as possible. With every connection
          made, we’re building a stronger, more united Armenian community — one
          event at a time.
